## Container classes

- a container class is a class designed to hold and organize multiple instances of another type (either another class, or a fundamental type)
- most commonly used container in programming is the array:
    - built-in array
    - array container class â€“ **std::array** and **std::vector**
- C++ containers typically only hold one type of data (because they are arrays)


### Most well-defined containers will include functions that:
- create an empty container (via a constructor)
- insert a new object into the container
- remove an object from the container
- report the number of objects currently in the container
- empty the container of all objects
- provide access to the stored objects
- sort the elements (optional)
